Hey there! Rajat here.

### Who am I?
I'm a student from Bangalore, pursuing the final lap of my bachelor's degree in Information Science and Engineering.

### What do I do?
I think and I expermient.
Well, with regards to computers and coding, I have the flexibility to quickly exeriment with and validate my thoughts and that's what I do beyond my academic commitments.
On the technical side of things I'm well-versed in Python, with experience in Flask, PyTorch, Numpy, Scikit-learn and Pandas.

### What am I pursuing?
Currently I'm pursuing my GCP ACE certification. Also, I'm learning Golang, Kubernetes and Microservices. 

### Why GeekyEscapades?
I find myself ideating a lot, but when it comes to validation, I'm not sure. So this blog is to put out into open my ideas, so that they are open for validation. Along with this, it gives me an opportunity to share what I've learnt.
