Hey there! Rajat here.

### Who am I?
I'm a student from Bangalore, pursuing the final lap of my bachelor's degree in Information Science and Engineering.

### What do I do?
I think and I expermient.
Well, with regards to computers and coding, I have the flexibility to quickly exeriment with and validate my thoughts and that's what I do beyond my academic commitments.
On the technical side of things I'm well-versed in Python, with experience in Flask, PyTorch, Numpy, Scikit-learn and Pandas.

### What am I pursuing?
Currently I'm pursuing my GCP ACE certification. Also, I'm learning Golang, Kubernetes and Microservices. 

### Why GeekyEscapades?
I've always felt the urge to share ideas that come to me, in order to learn and also share what I've learnt. GeekyEscapades is that space where I'll be sharing my ideas and experiments to gain feedback and share my experiences. Also, GeekyEscapades is the space where I'd like to take the liberty to be wrong, hoping to be corrected by someone.
